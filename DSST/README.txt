This MATLAB code implements the Discriminative Scale Space Tracker (DSST) [1]. The implementation is built upon the code provided by [2]. The code provided by [3] is used for computing the HOG features.

The project website is:
http://www.cvl.isy.liu.se/research/objrec/visualtracking/index.html

Installation:
To be able to run the "mexResize" function, try to use either one of the included mex-files or compile one of your own. OpenCV is needed for this. The existing compile scripts "compilemex.m" or "compilemex_win.m" can be modified for this purpose.

Instructions:
1) Run the "run_tracker.m" script in MATLAB.
2) Choose sequence (only "dog1" is included).
